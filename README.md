# globecs-it-test
Test task for the company "Globex IT"

## Tasks

- Draft a report according to the layout. Display a list of users in the report
- On the page there is a search by users. When you type in the search bar, the list is filtered
- When clicking on the card, display additional information on the user in the pop-up. When you click outside the information window or the cross, the window closes
- We get the list of users from the backend. To do this, you need to install and run the server locally. The link will be *http://127.0.0.1:3000*. To get the entire list, send a request without parameters, to get matches of the full name with the input string, add the query (term) parameters, for example *http://127.0.0.1:3000?term=fer*
